<blockquote>
  Build a medium.com style commenting / notes system. People can mark text and attach a comment to it. You can assume that
  the editor will not change the text afterwards. Make it work for a single user and a static text (no signup / login needed).
  Please use a REST-API to manage storage in a DB. You are free to use tools or frameworks that you feel comfortable with,
  but we prefer NodeJS, React, Redux. We know that you’re not a designer, but please try your best to make it look good (e.g
  styling and transitions)

<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you
  a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
  of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who
  do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone
  who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
  in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>

<p>To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from
  it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or
  one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
  dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they
  cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
  weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and
  easy to distinguish.</p>

<p>In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
  every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or
  the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The
  wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
  pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
